# Obsidian Custom Font Plugin

This plugin can apply any fonts to your obsidian vault. For now, you should find a woff version of your font and then place it inside `.obsidian/fonts` folder. Then, you can choose it from the settings menu of plugin and you would be all good. 

Tested fonts:

- [x] Woff 
- [x] TTF

Other font types are not tested but probably they are supported since we convert anything to base64. There shouldn't be any problem.
