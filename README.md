# Obsidian Custom Font Plugin

This plugin can apply any fonts to your obsidian vault. For now, you should find a woff version of your font and then place it inside `.obsidian/fonts` folder. Then, you can choose it from the settings menu of plugin and you would be all good. 

Currenty, I only support `.woff` font files. I plan to add other font files if requested.
